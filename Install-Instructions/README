What is this?
This is my most up to date and current configuration of Manjaro Linux running i3wm

Within these files you will find multiple text documents, follow the numbers and follow Step 1 first, then Setp 2 etc.

How do I use this?
Like mentioned above, simply follow the instructions that are printed in each document, remember to follow the steps in order or you may break something
